    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>
        Playing games during class is generally not recommended. It's important to focus on the lesson and prioritize your studies to succeed academically. However, if you choose to play games during class despite the potential distractions, and you get caught, it's essential to understand that the website itself is not responsible for any consequences you may face. The decision to play during class is entirely your own, and any disciplinary actions will be based on your choices, not the website's.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, playing games on this website during your free time is strongly encouraged. When you play during breaks or after class, you're minimizing the risk of any interference with your academic responsibilities. In such cases, you can enjoy the games without the worry of facing consequences for distracting yourself during very important lessons.
